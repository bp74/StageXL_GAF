#### Best solution to improve your workflow

* GAF greatly reduces the number of steps in game development workflow.
* Play any Flash 2D animation (explosions, cutscenes, characters, etc).
* No special pre-preparation needed to convert your Flash 2D animations.

#### High performance even on low-end hardware 

* High FPS by pre-rendering vector assets to texture atlases.
* Minimized draw-calls by using StageXLs rendering API.
* Built in support for HiDPI displays and textures.
