GAF = Best solution to improve game dev workflow

* GAF greatly reduces the number of steps in game development workflow.
* With GAF you can play any Flash 2D animation (explosions, cutscenes, characters, etc) on mobile devices.
* No special pre-preparation needed to convert your Adobe Flash Pro 2D animations into .gaf format.

GAF = High Performance

* High FPS, which is possible due to runtime libraries provided and supported by GAF Media;
* Minimal amount of drawcalls achieved by the means of using native API for each framework to control and manage animations;
* Highly optimized texture atlas to achieve minimal RAM consumption and build size
